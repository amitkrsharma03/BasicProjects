# 🖥️ Java Projects Collection

## 🚀 Overview
Welcome to my **Java Projects Collection**, a set of beginner-friendly yet functional applications developed using **Java and JFrame**. These projects serve as an introduction to GUI-based application development and demonstrate various Java programming concepts.

## 📌 Projects List

### 🎲 1. Double Rolling Dice Game
A simple yet fun dice game where players roll two dice and get random outcomes. Ideal for learning **randomization and event handling** in Java.

### 🆔 2. Identity Generator
An application that generates random identities, including names and basic details. Great for exploring **string manipulation and object-oriented programming**.

### 🔑 3. Random Password Generator (RPG)
A utility to generate strong, secure passwords of varying lengths. Implements **randomization, character sets, and basic cryptographic concepts**.

### ❌⭕ 4. Tic Tac Toe
A classic **2-player Tic Tac Toe game** with a responsive GUI. Focuses on **game logic, event listeners, and UI interaction**.

### ✅ 5. To-Do List
A simple task manager that lets users add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. Demonstrates **CRUD operations, list handling, and persistence (if added)**.

### 🔠 6. Hangman Game
A word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a word before running out of attempts. Implements **file handling, arrays, and user input validation**.

### 🎨 7. Paint Application
A **basic drawing application** where users can draw using different colors and brush sizes. Showcases **mouse event handling and graphics programming** in Java.
